## Product Details & Application Guide (Full Knowledge)

### 1. COSRX Low pH Good Morning Gel Cleanser  
**Power**: Gentle daily cleanser that removes excess sebum, dirt, and sweat without stripping natural oils. pH 5–6 matches skin’s natural acidity → prevents rebound oiliness, tightness, or barrier damage. Contains tea tree oil (mild antibacterial) and BHA (very low % for subtle exfoliation).  
**How to apply**: Wet face → pea-size amount → massage gently 30–60 sec → rinse thoroughly. Use AM & PM.  
**Why powerful for oily skin**: Keeps microbiome balanced, reduces shine over time, preps skin perfectly for actives.

### 2. Hada Labo Gokujyun Premium Hydrating Lotion  
**Power**: 7 types of hyaluronic acid (super, nano, medium, fermented, etc.) + saccharide isomerate + hydrolyzed collagen + palmitoyl tripeptide-5. Delivers deep, multi-layer hydration → plumps skin, minimizes pore appearance, improves elasticity, creates bouncy “chok chok” glow. No fragrance, alcohol, colorants.  
**How to apply**: After cleansing, pour generous amount (coin-size or more) into palms or cotton pad → pat gently all over face & neck until fully absorbed (30–60 sec). Can layer 2–3 times if skin feels thirsty.  
**Why powerful**: Turns dehydrated oily skin into hydrated oily skin → oil production normalizes, glow becomes natural and lasting.

### 3. The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%  
**Power**: High-potency niacinamide regulates sebum, strengthens barrier, fades dark spots, reduces inflammation, minimizes pores, evens texture. Zinc PCA controls oil and prevents acne. Proven in studies to improve skin clarity in 4–8 weeks.  
**How to apply**: 3–4 drops → spread evenly on face → pat until absorbed (wait 1–2 min before next step). Use AM daily + PM on recovery nights.  
**Why powerful**: Core product for oily skin glow — shine control + brightening without dryness.

### 4. COSRX The Retinol 0.1 Cream  
**Power**: Pure 0.1% retinol + panthenol + tocotrienol (super vitamin E). Promotes cell turnover → smoother texture, reduced fine lines, faded acne marks, refined pores. Low dose = minimal irritation, ideal for beginners and oily skin. Encapsulated for stability.  
**How to apply**: Pea-size (covers whole face) → apply thinly after Hada Labo on retinol nights → wait 5–10 min → follow with moisturizer. Start with 2 nights/week first month if very cautious.  
**Why powerful**: Long-term anti-aging + glow booster. Results visible from week 6 onward (smoother, brighter, firmer skin).

### 5. Skintific 5X Ceramide Barrier Repair Moisturizer Gel  
**Power**: 5 ceramides (NP, AP, EOP, AS, NS) + hyaluronic acid + centella asiatica + marine collagen. Repairs damaged barrier, locks in hydration for 24–48 hours, soothes retinol irritation, prevents moisture loss without greasiness. Lightweight gel melts instantly.  
**How to apply**: Pea-size to rice-grain amount → warm between palms → press gently all over face. Use slightly more on retinol nights.  
**Why powerful**: Prevents dryness from actives → oily skin stays balanced, plump, and dewy all day.

### 6. Biore UV Aqua Rich Watery Essence SPF50+ PA++++  
**Power**: Chemical filters (advanced stability) + hyaluronic acid. Ultra-light watery texture → no white cast, no greasiness, subtle hydrated finish. High UVA/UVB protection prevents pigmentation and collagen breakdown in Thailand’s strong sun.  
**How to apply**: 2-finger length amount (about 1/4 tsp) → apply as last step AM → reapply every 2–3 hours if outdoors.  
**Why powerful**: Essential for maintaining glow — blocks UV that causes dullness, dark spots, and premature aging.

**Tips for Forever Use**  
- Consistency > intensity. This routine is designed to be used lifelong.  
- If skin ever feels overwhelmed → drop one retinol night.  
- Expected glow timeline: noticeable at 4–6 weeks, full glass skin at 8–12 weeks, maintained forever.  
- Store products in cool, dark place (retinol especially).
