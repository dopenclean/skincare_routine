2. **Exfoliating Serum (PM only)**: The Skin Collection AHA 10% + BHA 2% Serum (red box)

## Morning Routine (Brighten + Hydrate + Protect)

1. **Cleanse**  
   - Use Bio-Essence Collagen Cleanser  
   - Wet face → massage gently → rinse thoroughly

2. **Serum**  
   - Apply The Skin Collection Niacinamide 10% + NAG 8% Serum (3–5 drops)  
   - Pat gently until absorbed  
   → Helps control oil and brighten throughout the day

3. **Moisturizer**  
   - Garnier Vitamin C Water Gel (pea-size or more)  
   - Spread evenly → absorbs quickly, non-greasy

4. **Sunscreen**  
   - Bioré UV Aqua Rich Watery Gel (generous amount ~¼ tsp for face)  
   - Apply as last step  
   - Reapply every 2–3 hours if outdoors

## Evening Routine (Repair + Exfoliate + Brighten)

1. **Cleanse**  
   - Same Bio-Essence Collagen Cleanser  
   - Double cleanse if wearing sunscreen/makeup

2. **Exfoliating Serum (2–3 nights per week only)**  
   - Apply The Skin Collection AHA 10% + BHA 2% Serum (3–4 drops) on dry skin  
   - Wait 10–20 minutes (may tingle slightly — normal)  
   - **Start slowly**: 2x/week → increase if no irritation  
   - On non-exfoliating nights → skip this step

3. **Brightening Serum**  
   - Apply Niacinamide 10% + NAG 8% Serum  
   - Wait 5–10 minutes after AHA/BHA if used together  
   → Calms skin, fades scars, controls oil

4. **Moisturizer**  
   - Garnier Vitamin C Water Gel  
   - Lock in all actives

## Important Tips
- **Patch test** the AHA/BHA serum first (behind ear or inner arm).
- Always wear sunscreen daily — actives (AHA/BHA + Vitamin C) increase sun sensitivity.
- If skin feels dry, tight, or irritated → reduce AHA/BHA frequency or use more moisturizer.
- Expect results (clearer, brighter, smoother skin) in 4–6 weeks with consistency.
- All products are lightweight and suitable for Thailand's hot/humid climate.

Enjoy clearer, glowy skin! ✨
