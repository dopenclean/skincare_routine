## 💡 Pro-Tips for Thailand
* **The "Wait" Rule:** Always wait for your skin to be dry before applying Retinol. Applying it on damp skin increases the risk of irritation in high humidity.
* **Sun Sensitivity:** Retinol makes your skin more prone to burning. If you plan to be outdoors (beach/hiking), skip the Retinol the night before.
* **Storage:** Keep your The Skin Collection serums in a cool, dark place (away from direct Thai sunlight) to maintain the potency of the actives.
